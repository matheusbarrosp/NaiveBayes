I gotta feeling they partlishly took it off fomr MIB anime ep form the american unless they took that one off from it, but the story is really different.
As we look at ways to be relevant, here is a good video perspective to consider (in order to avoid :) )
Not a lot of "removing" going on here... bucket teeth removal maybe.
I love looking at old gravestones
@qingian they represent HK. but considering how their last names are spelled, i think they are from China. they don't get to represent China because they're not as good as Ma Long, Zhang Jike and Xu XIn.
@Invaderkibachan2 xD Okay! Um, I finished, but the whole thing is only about nine seconds, so I feel like it'd be a waste to upload something so short as a video. Would it be possible for me to e-mail the file to you? Or upload it somewhere, and messa
so THATS why they always tell you to wear a helmet; i always thought the concept of damaging the head via falling off a bike was very unlikely

Yeah, because a minute and a half definitely equals 30 sec.
great guy but this wasnt a special video lets be honest
Yea..the Senior CIA analyst during Saddam's Era is definitely not a credible source. He's the last person who should be commenting on Iraq. Anyways... I'm done with this argument. Good Day sir.
Do anyone know if thats Jim Ryan in the background?
yes i agree i had an 07 ego then switched to angel a1 and a kid at my local field had one and it shot smoother than my a1 wich i belive was about 40% smoother than my ego now aday's all guns $ 300 and over will do 20bps out of the box its just how you like the feel of it thats why i went angel beacuse i love the way they feel,

Listen, fuck off. Just because you have something that is "yorkshire" does not mean you have to put t' in front of random fucking words in your desription. Yes we do it but not as fucking much as that. Do you do the subtitles for coronation street? Because apparently lancastrians do it all the time aswell

ITS CALLED TECHNO! The words make this song important, "The whole wide world is a very narrow bridge, but the important thing is not to worry."
The guy in the crowd at 1:07 reminds me of David Archuleta...?
fucking cunts.
Will is so talented! He is also my cousin lol
Only when we remember our "inalienable rights" were granted to us by God and not man will we be immune from the brainwashing this documentary uncovered. Those "crazy" psychiatrists proved that the inmates are often running the asylum. The Bible could not be more accurate in describing the human heart as "wicked & deceitful". We are selfish, play "mind games" and try to dominate each other in our families & also internationally. Our only hope resides in our humility and love of God.

@robokill387 That's not what he's trying to get across. Wolves don't make their teeth. He's saying if we were in the wild, With just ourselves, Just like the animal kingdom is, We would be extremely low on the food chain.
@ianxofour yeh and it was easy, like always :D
a+++ jolly good show

thanks for posting all of these Bernstein Mahler 3 movements. This is not only beautiful music interpretation, but also extremely fine filming. What a find for me here. Thank you.
you can get this on anime-online.c()m for ?1 if you want, its good.
i agree, the last minute and a half is musical perfection. I listen to all genres and I've never heard anything as beautiful as it sounds. It's what I imagine being played in heaven. no joke. It really shows their evolution as a band.
Ohh my bad xD
where are other episodes.
Hearns all the way. I love Sweetpea, but Hearns was not only a big hitter, he could outbox the hell outta guys as proven by the fact that his only loss by decision was at the age of 35. Hearn's may not of had the best chin but the guys who KO'ed him were big punchers, something Pernell was not IMO.Hearns by UD.

I don't have Fibromyalgia but I I do suffer from depression and insomnia. For my depression I take the generic of Prozac which is Fluoxetin. I take 50mg of that. For my insomnia I take the generic of Ambien which is Zolpidem (10-30mg). Usually I'm asleep within 30 minutes of taking the Zolpidem. It is extremely helpful. I hope I was able to help you in any way.
For starters it WAS NOT HITLER'S EMBLEM. It was originally the Buddhist Symbol for good luck. That probably explains why Hitler stole it.
I love synthesizers! this song is so uplifting and beautiful = )
that switch back tail vince did near the end was fucken sick!!!!!!!!hopefully he gets turned pro after the chocolate vid drops
That was masterfully done by Kurt Angle! That's why he is one of the best in the wrestling business today! Stone Cold thought he had angle beat and so did Booker T but out of nowhere and within a blink of an eye he turned the tables on them and became the WCW Champion! Well done Kurt Angle!
OMG ONLY 47 VIEWS!
he is a perfect presentation full package

One of the greatest displays of the human spirit in the history of mankind. The world will now look to Chile for inspiration. They did the impossible, all the trapped miners and rescue workers showed the world what unity is all about.

I have the NS7 and all I can say is can't numark just back up one product make that the flagship product and market the hell out of it. Why does numark always do the same thing over and over again? The v7 looks cool but honestly it's just a way to sucker us out of more money.
I've already done so, several times in fact, and all you do is keep citing the same discredited studies, links, and 'authorities'. And you've now expanded your bloviating to include 'every science academy on the planet'...Superlatives such as THAT are concessions on your part...as everyone can see.
Usual leftie, foaming at the mouth crap. National Union of Teachers - in other words commies who hate their own race. Thank God for the BNP. Come on Nick, let's get you into Westminster and really sicken them.

That's amazing! Now babies and young children can swim by themselves.
Even though I didn't know it at the time, living in Silver Lake in my early 20s was one of the best experiences of my life. I was going through some hard times back then, and if I hadn't been in such a tolerant, laid back community, my troubles would have metastasized. I will be forever grateful to the community of Silver Lake for giving me the space I needed to become the productive member of society I am today.
I keep coming back to your performance of this magnificent piece, surely one of the noblest in the organ repertoire. It combines youthful exuberance with a remarkably mature msical insight. A fine organ, too - but I would love to hear you repeat this on a real Cavaill?-Coll - St Sulpice or St Ouen, for example.
ya sure you do!??
bra sleepy will neva die uhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!
@thecomicbots Nice!!!
A Tribe is the effen best
hes voice sounds so different geez not like the other vestion of game of death the lost fotage
yea I hope she's alright
She is absolutely awesome for a 3 year old. It is amazing that she was able to memorize that whole routine at her age. However, I must agree with a lot of the posts. Her poor neck and spine take a lot of impact when she lands on her head like that. I bet a doctor would cringe if? they saw her do that over and over again. Hopefully she won't have any neck or back pain later in life from this. That being said, you are awesome little lady!!!
Wow the blonde girl is super yummy
those things are stupid. whats the point in having a BB30 frame if you convert it back to standard.its better to use BB30 bearings and then convert the Inner Diameter of the bearings down to shimano standard with Wheels Manufacturing adaptors.

I use this with my 11.5. The recoil reduction is noticeable, but not so much as a good comp like the fsc556.TEST, TEST, TEST this with your duty ammo if you in LE!! It works with Hornady 75 grain TAP, and with the 75 grain practice ammo that I've tried. I've seen it used with 55 grain TAP and 55 grain practice ammo without any trouble, but we didn't use much 55 grain TAP.

To me, the bailout was a necessary evil to prevent economic Armageddon. HOWEVER, the bailout should immediately have been followed with the kind of legislation being proposed here by Bernie, in that we force the Treasury to identify those banks that are dangerous to our country and to break them up -- Teddy Roosevelt-style. By taking the bailout, those banks showed that they don't deserve to stay intact.
for earth day, i celebrated by . . going to my local deli, purchasing as many sandwiches as possible, throwing them all in the trash, then taking those styrofoam boxes and digging them deep in the earth in various ity parks. it was awesome. i felt good afterward because i knew i had done my part that day!! also took all the non-biodegradable trash from my garbage and strewn it around as many school gardens as i could find.it truly was a WONDERFUL earth day!! yay!!!!
Glad you enjoyed it and thanks so much for the kind words!

@blue861000 I agree. Bullies & haters are wrong in every sense of the word.
Most convicted killers that have been cleared and freed didn't have as much evidence to exonerate them as there is for ALA. If ALA cannot be cleared on the prints, DNA and handwriting, nobody could ever be cleared of a crime. To accept ALA's guilt is to deny solid physical evidence in favor of witch hunting, sophistry, invented factoids and wild speculation. Some think that's stronger evidence than prints, DNA and handwriting. If that evidence is so weak, then nobody could ever be convicted.
Will be trying this tonight. I might bake them instead of frying. I just feel that potatoes especially mashed will soak up every bit of the oil. Frying is always yummier, but since I'm pregnant, everything fried gives me indigestion...

Great video Steve! I remember the first time I read John Muir's description of the ice cone, I was amazed by it. To see it through your eyes is pretty cool. Love the time lapse of the creek too.
@cdreddick34 Thanks for the advice I will consider that the next time I get them twisted up.
Thank you! :)
Fantastic. Thanks for posting. And Rod...sort it out!

that gave me chills. ...so very excellent.

@VeganButterfly Wow, you expect to have a civilized discourse with that kind of pessimistic dualistic attitude? The reason my responses seem "dumb" to you is because I'm pointing out all of the contradictory fallacies in your arguments. My responses are m

I wish the "Nashvilles" would pull their heads out of their asses and promote more music like this, there are very talented songwriters out there, but the Nashvilles are ignoring them. I don't understand why they are promoting this "Hip Hop" country of today. Sure it sells, but there is stuff out there that would sell better.
i think at 0:57 he was going for another soccer kick but then remembered he was in the WEC lol

PITIFUL that the federal govt doesn't give a damn about the very folks that voted them into office. It's absurd to enforce a regulation/law that REQUIRES a pharmacy, OR ANY BUSINESS, TO OPERATE BELOW COST! This is just plain WRONG! As we say in the South- That dog won't hunt".

In the past four years, Bayh collected more than $1.7 million in pre-tax income when she exercised stock options from two of the corporations. Her actual income from exercising stock options is higher, but the details of one transaction were not publicly reported.
Alison Moyet's looking bloody terrific! Wowser x
cavs have a terrible bench, pietrus outscored the whole bench and hes a bench warmer as well so cavs are a team that breaks in the playoffs so next season you will see lebron on the knicks

cuando va a ser el dia q piensen mas como deportistas y no como ingnorantes perdedores de la vida, q solo saben insultar a los demas equipos. Q lastima me da ver esto, y pensar q yo tambien soy uruguayo... me da asco la mentalidad de todos los fanaticos, q lo unico q hacen es agredir, y no respetan a los otros equipos... es muy facil odiar. Me imagino q es la mentalidad uruguaya, nos gusta lo facil. Q desgracia!! APOYEN EL DEPORTE MUCHACHOS, no la VIOLENCIA!
Yeah, actually I kind of felt that way myself. I'm probably going to go in and add a few more SMW areas to better even out the Sonic:Mario ratio.
Killer!
What a beautiful look that I can wear anywhere. I don't recall seeing you use pigments. Do you like them or use them? If so, I would like to see a step by step tutorial.
I would suggest that to stop it bowling outwards 1st slow your wheel down and 2nd make sure you collar the top in before lifting like I do which helps to counteract the centrifugal force wanting to throw it out widely.

Beautiful dog. Don't worry about the not like water once they find its fun there's no keeping them out believe me. Our darling can't help himself if it wet he has to jump in. Doesn't matter if it's a river, puddle or even the bath (when your in it!)

Wish he was my professor. But what kind of DUM students is he teaching???
@herofromthedark Yes, but a CATCHY oxymoron. ;D
Wow, I'm very impressed. I actually felt my chakras and as I let the music take over I started to 'see' patterns like the patterns on the vid! Great work! I think I'll wait until you create that dvd for the best quality. I heard that compress music degrades the quality thus degrading the effects of the music. My friend told me they did a study on plants where they played analog, cd, and mp3 quality music and mp3 plants grew the least. Anyone hear about this study? Thanks again!

don't you worry no more - Most of us posting here are from the baby boomers, moslty over 50, wonder why there is so much garbage songs out there, the generations to come will never hear these songs...
ok, i got to watch this again today, and I have to say I love it even more! The music and scene selection was perfect and tied together very nicely, and I like the little effects in this that made a big difference! This is one of my favorite videos for A tale of two sis. <3
this is a killer !
Why is Vanessa so rude to him? He seems like a REALLY cool guy! Vanessa is also very knowledgeable and a pretty cool chic.
sooo boring
Great catch on the comment, dead org is dead, that's a beautiful sight.(love the squirrel!)
I actually watched Order of the Phoenix for the first time on friday. And it is far superior to both the third and fourth installments. I am glad they chose Yates to direct the remaining films. They certainly live up to the standard set by the first two. One thing about the music in Order of the phoenix: it was well-written, but in some places, the arrangement was way off, and lost its effect. While it was still good, it is clear that none can compare to Williams.
if looks could kill is such a good song to blasst in my car

i'm not sure if you know this, but its totally illegal to video record at a feis because you can steal other peoples steps. just and fyi in case you later find out that you are not allowed to compete again because of this video.... if you would like critiques from others you should post a video recorded from class or a show.... hate to be the downer, but that's why there are rules................ good luck with your dancing though
I wish I could pull on your beard!
thats awsome.
Sorry, but i think you have the wrong Chris. Or you might just be messing around.
@FintyWalsh lol yeah. that made me laugh so hard. I love the ending scenes.
did they cut it down because of the lightning strike? did it kill it?
very imaginative take on the original! i think that ojarv001 set his to 3/4 time, and yours is in 4/4 time. but i still like it :)

Why the hell does everyone cares about his profuse sweating? I do find that kind of akward. Oh, and for the record, those stage lights are extremely hot.
ah, but what is the point, stripped down to what it is? the point is: the poor people are being fucked over by the rich people. that's what it boils down to. the rich buy our legislators and make our laws. we are owned and as long as we can go home and watch the game and drink and eat too much, we'll buy in and go to a job we hate which makes us miserable, and be led right along the path they want us to take. like good little sheep.
People tend to forget if it were not the pioneers even though there was tragedy

A very nice rendition of Ivor Novello`s song by a wonderful singer, lets hear more.
Keep it coming!! The congregations need more of this. It is pure music, singing and lyrics truly praising Yeshua the Messiah. Also, very TRUE to the Scriptures. Just beautiful, Ms. Davis. Bless you.

They want us to afford them the protection of our laws but at the same time, they will deny you even the basic right to free speech. Don't be fooled. Islam is here to become dominant.

Please view my new Tree of Life video. Thank you.
Fantastic <3

Thank you for the excellent presentation, Warren. My father and I were discussing our country's poor leadership last night. Self-centered elitists have taken control of govt.. As you say, people who think of themselves first and society last. Sad. I started reading "Critical Path". Fuller is a little hard to read, but it's good. I agree with his theory of man beginning in Austral-Asia. Fascinating!

How dare you say that catholics secretly worship Lucifer in your comments. It makes no sense whatsoever and shows your research is flawed. Masonary, Theosophy and many more (self admittedly), but Catholic dogmas are anything but secret and completely anti thetical to what you suggest.

I am as a Science Fiction Fan embarrassed to admit I hate the Foundation "trilogy"... I do, however, LOVE his ability to make Science Fact palatable to people like me, and I also love his early Novels and stories. I admire the Man also. Just don't see Foundation as his best work...
Mon Scotland!!! Love this makes me cry laughing you rock xxx
nice trampoline man, my mom wont let me take off my net, but rj has his net off and hes younger than me.
This whole taking a test to pass to the next grade started when Bush did the No Child Left Behind Act if you read the legislation it really is not very helpful to the kids, teachers or parents! I know some schools actually teach the test currently schools funding from the government and how much teachers are paid is based on the test scores. It's good in some ways but over all I don't think it's effective. That's just my 2 cents.
how can u hate bill bailey he's a ledgend!

Wrong. Nobody works harder than Iowa. Perhaps you watched 1 practice etc... Minnesota works hard, but do you think it's because J. Robinson spent so much tme as an assistant at Iowa?Dan Gable is regarded as the hardest worker EVER, and that mentality and culture has continued there. Check the number of NCAA titles they have won since 1975.

G. Bush was a total frailer. But look ad you president Obama, you are my inspiration, here you are ad your best, this speech was the best speech I have heard in a life time. It applauds not only the great students but also for the US nation and all regions on the world. 
Well, ya know, everyone has an opinion. And in my opinion, your opinion is SHIT!
Yes it is.
These kinds of lies don't work anymore.
@lovelydove,I just went to your channel & saw your "favorites." You listen to George Bloomer (a false prophet)? & you're interested in hatha yoga (a demonic practice from Hinduism)?? ...No wonder you called my comments "negative"....you have itching ears

Very interesting. I found her show and she has some great ones. The problem I have with most paranormal shows it seems they spend all their time either A.Interviewing each other over and over. Or B.Slamming each other. So finding hers was refreshing. Thanks for leading me that way.
I love these guys!
get it kidds.they lookk likee they having fun!
PINGAS...ANOYYING
I heard about this on This American Life
The Bush administration attached no accountability for the first bail-out, nice that you are trying to imply that its the Obama administration that gave the banks the money. He saw what Bush and co. did and is actually helping Americans not private companies. Lay the blame at the right feet, the right and they are still kicking and scatching every step of the way. We are taking American back it been 2 weeks let see the right-wing-nuts in 2 years, We are taking America back for true Americans.

Disgusting. Our country is in ruins.
I bought $300K in gold 3 years ago on Peter's advice (bullion). I bought it at about $580/oz if I recall.Smart people listen to guys like Peter Schiff, Alex Jones, Ron Paul, Joesph Stiglitz, to name a few.
blues are pretty (:
I wish more of the youth today would take their mind out of mind off B.E.T. and see whats going on. We've got to break these generational curses and kill our slave mentality. Though i don't feel like every brother is a brother(alot will sell you out quick) we can at least live together without always killing each other. We weren't given our 40 acres and a mule...SO NOW WE HAVE TO TAKE IT!! GOD BLESS

From my understanding of biology freezing living cells alters the cells especially when unfrozen....something with salts bursting the cell membrane...hm maybe that only applies to mammals cells? Heck, I'd still eat it.

I shot this to show on a big screen at the West Cliff House Owners' Association AGM in the Salt House on 28th April, so folks had something to watch before the meeting began. It was at the time Google was in the headlines cruising round the UK with car-cams, so it was topical. As for opening the gate, I wanted the cruise to be circular so it could run and run. If you look carefully, you'll see it was patched together from 3 separate runs!

And he was forced to flee Jamaica after one of his early concerts, later returning to join up with the Wailers. SO it isn't crazy to think he was assasinated, but as it stands right now, most of the evidence points towards a natural death (cancer). Unless someone has turned up new evidence, which I would REALLY be interested in hearing.

4 weeks prior to 9/11 my son and I flew to Brazil, we saw no high security in the 2 US airports through which we passed. When we arrived at GRU the airport was filled with Military, Police, sniffer dogs, security was intense. I asked what was going on, they said there are terrorist threats to airports! Everywhere we went in SP we saw high security, embassies, public bldgs, shopping centers, etc. We returned 5 days before 9/11, still no high security in the 2 US airports...who dropped the ball?

I saw Roger Waters performing Dark Side of the Moon and others on July 12, 2007 at Darien Lake, NY, best show ever. He opened with this song, but the visuals were different; in my opinion, way cooler, because instead of a picture, it was the video of the hammers marching along with the rhytum of the music, occasionally changing from white to red, and back. To agree with you, perfect song to open with!

Just because something affects society doesn't classify it as a "social issue." Every issue affects society, so by that logic every issue is a "social issue" and why even put "social" in there, just call them "issues."lol fuck semantics anyways.Capitalism may be greed based, but that's because we're greedy by nature, civilized or not. Also, calling people idiots for not bowing to your beliefs does nothing to convince anybody.

Sounds like your tomatoes aren't being pollinated. Do you have enough bees in your area? You can pollinate your tomatoes yourself with a small paint brush. Just touch each tomatoe blossom with the tip of the paintbrush as a bee would do. You should get a better yield. Also, thin out the bloooms so you only have two tomatoes on each stem. This will allow them to develop into bigger, more tastey tomatoes. Good luck.

Noa: yea, you woulda been OK as long as the roux was in the same temperature range as the stock AND the stock was not too "greasy" to begin with (SUBSCRIBE! see "magic dinner party video" for stock scumming & degreasing techniques). For demi's- I still MUCH prefer: 1) au natural 2) Arrowroot slurry over roux. keep it up, Kid, your gonna do fine.
What song is this??
thats right man homey
Still my favourite album from Esem.

Thanks for your kind comment! I picked this little whistle up in a thrift store for $2 about three months ago, sanitized it, played it once and set it aside - it sounded REALLY rough.

He says multiple times that an angel said that he's going to see Jehovah. Fascinating. An angel uses a mistranslation of the name YHWH (Yahweh) from the middle ages (1500 a.d. or so). I don't see why an angel would use a mistranslated name when referring to Almighty God in His Heaven.

Because it's hard to save up money in the original. Besides, you're always gonna buy new weapons because the enemies get tougher. For example, you don't need to buy the Walloper (though it will help in Gaspar), you absolutely need to buy the Devastator, since it's gonna have to be your first big source of damage UNTIL you buy the R.Y.N.O.
It's "From Yesterday" by 30 seconds to Mars

I saw this tour in Boston and I swear the beginning of Stand Back was different. It was a sound a wave that started out soft and no one knew what song was coming till it got louder and louder and then the synths kicked in. Does anyone else remember this? No-I wasn't high!
Awesome, I needed a guide on this achievement.

Genies in bottles, toothpaste in tubes....

People who once held these same positions 50 years ago, thought marijuana caused Blacks and Mexicans to rape white women, that "reefer madness" was real.How long can an oligarchy monkey fuck the truth and we stand around and take it?

@MatthiasVargas not really. while it is true in the NC case, as there are directly contradicting laws, in the case of banning christianity for example, it says, congress shall make no law, and not that such law could not be made by a state. so a state law

6.2 engines do have there weaknesses like overheating but u can upgrade the fan and coolent system. also the heads are known to get spider cracks in them. and cranks break from the harmonic balencer rubber rotting away throwing it off balance. and people put in stud girdles on the lower end to prevent main bearing web cracks. i know people put in gear drives to replace the timing chains too. as for the 86 sub it cracks on the frame where the steering box bolts on. but theres a brace to fix that.

Pasa el tiempo y uno ya no es un chiquillo. Como adulto joven apreciaba el estilo picaresco de los Troveros Criollos pero como un duo, Garland-Perez. Sin embargo, en mi mente me titileaban los nombres de Pejovez y Ladd. Esta marinera del maestro Manuel Acosta, ha terminado por confirmar mis lejanos recuerdos. Que epoca la de los cincuenta en el siglo pasado. Cuanta musica criolla se hizo, cuantos conjuntos, solistas, compositores y autores alcanzaron la gloria. Viva la musica criolla carajo!

Okay, even his own brother suspected him while he suspected his brother. So even though it hurts that Duen suspects, she really can't be blamed, especially since she HASN'T known him that long (like his brother has) and he refuses to explain stuff to her.! arg. But, I still find her pushiness a little annoying. I don't care about her believing him, but I wish she'd believe HER brother's prediction. oh well...

Check out DNA activation synchronicity, that's no maybe. The Universe is NOT a "giant maybe"- read about Unified Field Theory - Youtube search Nassim Haramein's work. The time is always NOW, you are not random and "maybe".
I've seen this shelter and it's wonderful. So much TLC for all the cats.

damn Chris! Just when I thought Cosmo was my favorite song from you, I come across this and now I can't decide. Another great original song! And after a second listen, I realized "six lane highway" was a very clever metaphor haha AWESOME. Can't wait to hear more originals!
I agree with you
pedicure chairs looks uncomfortable &+ no massage..
And another thing: Where do you find these washers? Lowes and Home Depot DOES NOT CARRY these washers. I spent a half of day and about a half of a tank of gas to find a 25 cents washer. God have mercy on my soul.

Just absolutely beautiful.

youre work is amazing. actually, at school we are doing a thing for "a person you would like to teach at your school and why" normally, when writing i rush through (about 3 lines at the most), but when writing about mark crilley i go half a page!
Very nice!
Superb on the live set too - a great song. SImone Felice has put together a great band - so good to hear his heart ticking!
this song is pretty good this is a good song so ill put it in my ipod..........
Actually, they were not made for children, but for the general public as a more affordable way to buy records. They were produced between 1914-1923. If you check out Little Wonder # 249 I have on here, there's a lot of background and history of these great records I added with that song. Thanks for listening!
STOP SITTING ON THE BILL AND BE A AMERICAN! WE NEED A SENETOR AND SENATE THAT WILL STOP THE HOA IN TEXAS AND MAKE US A PART OF THE UNITED STATES AGAIN, HOA IS UN AMERICAN!
When he said Melee was better he was obviously talking about gameplay. Yes Brawl owns Melee when it comes to features. However Classic, Allstar, Event Match and ESPECIALLY Targets were butchered in Brawl. You can't even use online against Melee anyway because Brawl was a duel laired disk and the gamecube didn't have Wifi connection. Okay here's where Brawl dies in my eyes. The gameplay...IT WAS NOOBED! FOR THE CASUAL GAMERS! Almost all of the hitstun was removed, and they added tripping, and...

This car is fantastic! I drove one last week and absolutely loved it! It looks gorgeous, rides so well and is so nippy for a 1.0-litre you don't need anything else! Go for the 1.0-litre manual and you won't even have to pay road tax! Brilliant!
@Turnback Good response.
Yes but losing doesnt mean dying. The Japanese had a code of honour. They WOULD win or die trying. Terrifying and Brave. Dont say cowardly as its ANYTHING but.
Great !!

thats coming from a fag who sings into a camera in his bedroom! lol i captured this in the gym as my heaviest squat, and i was quit pleased with myself but never considered weight training as being a homosexual activity until now! so thanks for that i will call it a day and take up something more manly like playing the banjo, acoustic guitar, singing or perhaps ballet. only joking your songs aren't bad had i little listen :-)
to hear this song make me go up and dance to the music.Love tradition Khmer dance(Ramvong).

Part 2 of 9 - After watching it - reconciliation of Lebanese people is a true democracy. Nadin, best ever film directed for the west and east and of course for the whole world. . Truly a great film. I loved it and liked it. Excellent piece of work.

so when mr kraft said his ex wife was behind it he knew she was a witch?
love the tune from 4:15 to 5:40
I find this very captivating, awe inspiring. A very impressive interpretation of the song and it's meaning, where the hell was my animation class in middle or high school? Damn.. I would have loved to have a chance to take that.

What would happen if Weegee fought against Light from Deathnote in Mugen? Who would win?
Sad thing about the Maxima is that it SUCKS unless it's loaded up with features. what sucks about it is the way it feels and handles and the S model's suspension is WAY too soft and bouncy. the gas pedal allows no modulation, and the car isn't the easiest feeling to drive. I'm talking about the base model S only, the loaded up ones with sport suspension are awesome though.
lol how she gonna have makeup on coming out the water

Huffdaddy72801- you are offering false, misleading teachings on christianity. Your so-called 'bilblical unitarianism' doesn't exist anywhere in the bible as anyone who reads and studies the Bible knows quite clearly
@Nightshade715 Yea, the hardest are the 'follow' or 'stalk' quests... but you get used to it. :P
what does that even mean???? lots of big words that sound clever and mean nothing. The only thing that made any sense was that we are all connected. But anybody with eyes could see that.
how did you put the mountains and continuous sky there
Best best ;-)

@andy55055 You missed the point here in a very dramatic way. I believe in Creation because I know God. And yes, there are only 2 ways "this" all happened. #1, God spoke it into existence with order and purpose, or #2 it all just began on its own without

This is about WP, or White Plains in New York I live there and my math teacher used to go to bars with him and 2 years ago when he was still known as Matt Miller he came to my 8th Grade math class and beatboxed. It was pretty sick.

I'm going to boot up my laptop and take shit while watching this. It's like eating Mcdonalds while watching a Mcdonalds commercial. So satisfying.
great cover, except a couple small things. First, congrats on having a good enough ear to down tune yer bass a half step. On the bad side though, listen to the stops. The last note in the main riff is either stopped short, not sustained, OR it slides up to the octive D# (E on a standard tuning). Other than that minor thing good job woohoooooooooooooo
really nice! like an impromtu rot hod!
Sad that hes no longer with fsn so i just turn on my tv at home turn it all the way down and put the radio on The X just to listen to lange!
OMJ!!post soon!

I don't even have to watch this video to write this. That's one I watch often but won't subscribe to. I generally watch every sub vid as they come. I have to be in the right mood to watch the meltdown. When in the mood I search Bethzilla and watch as much as I can take or until caught up.Nice imitation on the intro.

It sounds to me that Hitler has been reincarnated in the form of Lord Ahmed. Let us all rally to get riid of him before he helps the Muslims to take over this country. Although I admit there are some good muslims amongst these evil people who live under the cover of religion so they can get away with Murder.
I love this music ... This song was pre loaded on my laptop when I purchased it . Every time I play it I get teased...lol, it goes well w/ your slide show

Probably so. Dwight was on Flaco's "Partners" album around this time, and he took Flaco on the road with him.BTW, if you've never heard that album, it's worth a spin. Dwight does Warren Zevon's "Carmalita" with Flaco. Good stuff!

Thank you Jesus. When I was 8, I heard about a man who loved me so much that He gave His very life for me. He is the best friend I've ever had. I heard about Him, and now I'm trying to tell others about Him too..

@Imperi4 You are correct and incorrect. Slam is indeed a waste. using DW and wreck at the start insures maximum usage throughout the fight. at least at high levels of gear hit capping is very good because of the rage generation. And as for mastery me and
it is excessive force, no dicipline taken from Sgt. Jesse Garcia to those men who did that.. the cop that did the kicking n punching, send his ass over here id like to whip his ass, along with that other cop punching and tazered him 3 times. friggen rediculas.

We are not trained technicians here and are using the VCA description to explain the end result, which is volume. If you could explain a different way to us on what is happening then we will use that information to explain to others in the future. We just took it that being an electronic instrument that it would be using voltage to control the amplitude.

I'm curious. Why the Kinman p/ups? Why not a set of Seymour Duncan's? There are currently at least 3 Seymour Duncan's on Ebay for ?20 a piece or a full set for ?118. Nice guitar though, sounds great! How about a replica of the red Strat with the EMG active p/ups?

i have a question thumbs up if u agree with me. Why do people watch a video just to hit the dislike button and make inquisitive people like me ask questions? It seems like a waste of time to me.
That crowd is sick... how did you control the dancing woman without riot control?!
stupiddddd.....
Well. This song is rather blatant looking at it one way and rather ambiguously worded looking at it from the other angle.Allude to sex on the internet -> Preteens go crazy
Just remember that they don't control us through lies, they will try and control us through truth. Look to our national constitution and State constitutions. They are the Supreme Laws of the Land. Our forefathers saw this day coming. Some say that it is their GOAL to overthrow this great country through a third party. See the truth, but refuse their solutions. Their biggest fear is that we will remember the words that built a nation. Our rights are endowed to us by our "creator".
DL Is Really Boring iDK how he a king of comedy n he use da same jokes every stand up jus in diff order
Well, this company is a scam to a certain degree. The coins being marketed by Numis Network don't need to be in slab cases. This is simply a marketing strategy used by this company to sell silver coins as "Collectibles". There is more money to? be made selling coins as "Collectibles" (i.e. overpriced); but, again the silver coins being marketed by this company are simply hedges against inflation and it doesn't matter if they have been mishandled, or have scratches on them.
thanks for the video! great job!
Introspective is now 22 years old and sounds like they made it yesterday. Brilliant.

how do you know? you met shannon on tour?!?
That IS NOT a Piper PA-28. That IS a Cessna Skylane C-182. PA-28's don't have those long skinny landing gears. And the elevator is completely different. A search for the tail number reveals is a C-182. I can't figure out how the media called this one a Piper as for them all small airplanes they call them Cessnas ;)

Yup. It will pass through the audio to your receiver. So you can do 5.1, 6.1, 7.1... whatever.The audio jack is also an optical out.

awesome video. i like the old grill better though
you can see the silhouette of Black Jesus smiling down on you from inside the sun
LOVE THIS!!!! 
@antjd3 I think he made the news pretty easily recently.
Commodore Stone does a good job of ringing that bell. If he gets tired of being a commodore, he might do well as a good humor man. Lt. Shaw, however, is probably the worst prosecuting attorney of all time. She lets Spock make speeches on the witness stand, and she can't see Cogley's defense coming from a mile away. Good looking chick, though, and in Starfleet that's all the qualification needed.
@axel1million Check out thoruim alliance channel on youtube or on google tech talks.according to them thorium seems very promising and reasonably safe sounds almost to good to be true.
Oh I love him Robin! Can't wait to see him at the inspection.
Jesus warned of "false Christs" and deceivers who would come to mislead the masses, saying, "... they will kill you and think they do God a service." Do not follow the agents of Antichrist!
can you tell me where did he go?
Ahhhhhh, This Songg Is On "Pretty Little LIars" When Toby IS getting Aressed /:

I have personally met with at least two such people. Once was a Polish Jewish woman who went through Nazi concentration camps, and then through Soviet Labor camps. She said it was pretty much the same thing.
Agenda genocide. Very nice.
Thanks. I'm getting into green juice and spirulina now, and I'm eating fresh vegetables and salad all the time and I feel great for it! A question though, do I need to eat all my food raw? At the moment I eat boiled sweet potatoes and steamed veg. I also drink cucumber juice. I'm vegetarian now, but I need to go completely vegan. ALso, how do you feel about alcohol? 
James Gregory for President!!!
@premo459 It's important because this is probably the first feature film the US has ever made, and it shows how we should not portray some people in film, such as the African Americans. In school you have to learn about the events of The Civil War and t

i understand how people think GaGa is a cher copy...however. I dont think thats really true. Sure, GaGa is way out there, so was Cher. But the music is different and I think GaGa just took inspiration from all of the greats, and has still created her own person. you can love them all.
are the achivments eazy?
You should put some extra long sliders on you ass
the intro reminds me of pantera so much
i hav 2 agree with u. I understand where u are coming from though FantasiaP. I also used 2 struggle with the alot 2.
I feel something's unusually clever about this.
I LOVED Davey/Romero. Those stiff kicks really made it great. I love that puro style. I remember a point where Davey was gonna kick Romero in the head but Romero moved and Davey SLAMMED his ankle against the ring post. That looked like it hurt A LOT. Btw, you said you gave Davey/Romero ***3/4 but in the description you put **3/4. Just saying since you probably didn't notice.Btw that asian chick's name is Jade Chung.GREAT VIDEO!
Nice one! Land Surveyors all over the world must have fun.Check out my site for some Scottish surveying fun as well as some Scottish scenery.

@SploderMaster Over populate ? Yes ,true but the jobs that the Latin american people do are the low profile jobs. Such as hard critical manual labour. Which involves a lot of physical stamina. Dish washing and etc. If they are doing low profile jobs like

Okay that all sounds wonderfull. Where can I buy one?
Agreed!!!! In this day and age "doing the right thing" often comes with a lawsuit for the do gooder. It's sad to say but i think as long as he called the authorities he did the right thing!
As long as the GOP is for tax loop holes that encourage US corps to use Chinese slave labor, and for deregulating the criminal bankers, and holding up SBA lending to small business, and for taxing billionaire hedgefund managers? at 15% when I pay over 20%..as long as the GOP is for this BS..they are not on my side and they don't get my support.True, Obama is late to the game, helping small business but the GOP are just obstructionists.
I wasn't sure at first, but the end product is really gorgeous! Great job!

Very impressive selection, incredible playback off those 78s! I'm a blues guy, and haven't heard some of these. Tasty!

I wasn't directly talking about violent video games.I'm coming from a point of competition. Despite demographics, Nintendo used the event to find ways to one-up a competitor. Afterward, with the adoption of the ESRB, Nintendo allows violence in their games, such as the SNES version of MK 2.This business, like any other that's entertainment-related and has large sums of revenue involved, is cut-throat with contenders doing a lot of backstabbing stuff to each other out of the public eye.

His handwriting is amazingly good. It's interesting how much repetition exists in math. A development of a topic involves such a gradual transformation of ideas. It's very gentle. Math pokes at the imagination in a very powerful way. That lecture hall seems like a happy place. I wish I was there. I would play firsbee afterwards.
Yeah I noticed, juggernaught, claymores, x3, everything sorted... Oh and btw that shotgun kill streak was inspiring :D It's nice to see they've upped their close range damage. Tuesday will never come soon enough :(

@dinomand What are you guys so afraid of? The assumption that war must be part of the mix is a product of the fear mongering academicians. Let people control their destinies, it's called freedom.

Ha! You should see me when we get severe weather. I've got the TV on the local news, radar maps on my computer, emergency alert streaming through my radio. I feel like I'm part of the emergency weather response team or something. My wife always teases me about it. But yeah, it's pretty exciting, except for when they say a tornado is coming your way and you don't have a basement... yeah, then it sucks.
Sporks. Hehe.
Good shooting,thx
WTF is that thing in the picture?!?! And kudos on your mature discussion!
i wouldent mind knowing the name of that tune that plays in the back ground at the beginning of this part
Yep; I'm glad you're anticipating it (despite the skip before round 2). There's plenty more to come!
Are they starting just by alerting to treats, or are you already associating another odor as well?
Great video and jump. I've got some to post of First, Pavonly, Hutchinson, Akaidyn and Beck doing the same jump. Cool to see!

How does this kind of sewer scum logic get rewarded by positions in academia. Wolfowitz, of Team B, was working at Johns Hopkins Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies (Nitze, also of Team B).The social sciences are an embarrassment to the word "science".

I like to think that after he finished, he went back to his desk, rolled his d20 and screamed, "YES!! CRITICAL HIT to the administration! And I'm wearing my +1 suit!" before putting on spock ears and pulling out his toy lightsaber.
If you check his paige all his comments are to younger looking girls...I'm not familiar with you tube but please someone do somenthing about this POS. Like Mr. Charlie Daniells says, the lowest scum on this earth is a child molester

Yep, the temple of Solomon is the key to being able to shift between dimensions. According to Islam King Solomon was the only prophet who had special powers given to him by God. These powers meant King Solomon could travel between dimensions, so to reconstruct the temple is a must for the iniquitous nwo.Peace to all mankind!
That's not what he meant. The comment refers to Daniel Ellsberg's reaction upon obtaining access to the top secret Pentagon Papers that detailed the origin and nature of US involvement in Vietnam since 1945.

The FBI has cleared more 147 gr BONDED 9mm loads than any other load, because it penetrates more than 12 inches and less than 18 inches, and the 147 gr actually pedals out better because instead of "exploding" on impact it expands on impact, if anybodys interested i can actually provide an entire webpage on different loads and how they perform compared to other loads and how the 9mm, .40, .45, and .357 sig compare to each other anybody whos interested just message me and i will provide the link

This is a brilliant way to show the pathetic service that Virgin Media call webmail - you'd be better sending a letter!They are the WORST ISP EVER!BTW - they only support Windows.Service crap,GUI crap, storage crap (50Mb!) support crap, speed crap and you can't contact them without having to pay for itYou have my sympathy. Spread the word - Virgin Media are CRAP!BTW, I don't think they're owned by Branson anymore.If I could take my email addy with me (had it for 10 years!) I'd leave today.

You seem like a smart guy, but to gain popularity you need to gain speech making skills. I suggest getting a good public speaking book from the library and practicing. Being intelligent is only half the battle, you also need to sound intelligent too.

>>EagleTalonZCaltrain actually has a big problem with suicides. However, the tracks will be grade-separated and secured over the next 10 years for high-speed rail. This of course means fewer (if any) suicides, no more crossing bells and horns, and smoother traffic. So, does Sunnyvale sound any nicer :-) ?

Why the fuck would they give a fuck about your knee pads? I don't see anything weird about them.
Kylie Minogue is a billion dollar global cottage industry. She is able to sell out the O2 Arena (20,000 seats) ten nights in a row, and is deep into the iPod era still able to consistently deliver multi-platinum global sales. The foolish and uninformed statements on this forum show how out of touch with reality many people are. Its the music BUSINESS! Kylie can pull global live gate that would make Katy Perry quit music. Kylie has made far more revenue than Britney Spears ever will, FACT.

The Cop responds to the woman "No, He's saying you're tresspassing on city property". Well doesn't the cop have the duty to know the law and uphold it? Shouldn't the cop have told the guy who was protesting the Librarian that she was within her CONSTITUTIONAL rights to be there with a sign???????

I'm so confused about this. Why would the US do this to it's own troops? I'm a United States Citizen. Doesn't the US need its troops? Why would the government make its troops sick? ...Please someone clear this up for me.

@howardmciii , thats a matter of opinion. So what it was an academy award nominee. The movies he named describe the hood, they represent the inner city, the black community. The acting,directing and motion picture were better in Rebound,that's how it is

.... But I never can think of the right thing to say until everybody's gone home...Was reminded of this famous line of dialogue today -- unreal how great Hollywood was when it was. Conservatism even makes better comedies. Ryskind was a conservative and Obama could learn a thing or two from this film...

0:02 Was that a soaking wet condom wrapper on the ground?
Seems like the last few stories like these, like the girl in her dorm getting swastikas on her door, all have turned out to be the person doing it themselves.They set up a camera to catch the anti-semite, and instead found her drawing it, then calling and crying saying someone was going to kill her.
very well done for a none economics person - informative and not boring - Thx
8:48 omg the girl on the righttt..
SING CHRIS!

Who cares if the Japanese are hunting whiles? I don't know if greenpeace gets government backing at all or not, but I don't want my tax dollars supporting this rogue organization. If so, I'm going to write my senator.
@swu880 hell there are so many ways of making a stable structure such that it could stand with half its columns, or even a quarter of its support columns, or even lessits all about REDUNDANCY & good design

Oh yeah, I can see it when you first spin it. Thx.

Don't use google! There are other search engines you can go through for the same info. Also there are host sites that will "search" for you. Maintaining your privacy for a small fee.Good Vid Bro!
the amount of fear mongering over this on the tv lately is rediculous. this is no more fatal then seasonal flu. alot of these fatalities they report are people who died from other causes that just so happend to also have h1n1 at the time.

It is referring to the original Air Date

I remember my housemates and I crowding around my television to watch this; we loved it, it was such a good spin-off.
Food is food.
well thats just the shake pulling through the mouthpiece.learn to roll the mouthpiece of your blunts and joints better and you won't have this problem.sometimes i put a few little stems in the mouthpiece to keep any buds from getting through
No shit it altars weather patterns ` this caused the earthquake in China in 2008 ` the earthquake sure did grab attention away from the brutality in Tibet.

The boost force direction is opposite the camera moving direction.
words can't describe how much I hate this song, and how I nearly kill myself singing it in Lego Rock Band
wait who sings this.........? XD
Every song he ever sings makes you feel like you are really there and can or have lived in that moment.
hi sunny. i live on the east coasts long island. i have about ten black wallnut trees on my horse farm and i just went out to pick a bout 100 today and now i need to crack them. last year, i had a harvest of about 1,000,000 and my italian grandmother came up with a new way to crack open the wallnut. what she did was put it in a sock and beat them with a hammer. try this idea and tell us what you think. is it easer than the nut cracker
Why I love my knight xD
The film is good but the message is very obvious and biased. It's basic premise is to honor the draft regardless the price or the mission. Long live the republic, but may the empire it has become become may never sustain the agony it's inflicted on the world.
You should use your knight to search vats and other things that could possibly hurt you because he can take the most punishment.
Purely Adorable!!!!
this match was way better than mike mo vs. billy marks
I still miss Louie Kaboom!
Vary nice work. Excellent detail, I want one too just a wee bit bigger. I can here myself from DX land cool.
They need a higher rating system for this one. Absolutely amazing in every way! Quite possibly the most original concept on youtube. Keep up the good work.

sorry but pittiful
I have no idea what "yes, idiot" is supposed to mean. Ditto goes for your "YOU!" comment.As for "cock" meaning both, then it would be equivalent to our "dick", which is generally not bleeped when used to refer to a person.
Heavily edited with ads......there is like a half hour missing from this movie WTF? What a rip-off!
@AttitudeEra9701 hell yea i peep dat 2
You should be able to do this in CompositeLab. We filmed the actor against a greenscreen, then animated him disappearing into the floor. A displacement filter was applied to create the wibbly effect. The full DVD has more info.The easiest way to apply a mask to grading is to use a grade object, which can be found in the 'effects browser'. This can then be masked like any other object.
eh, blue beam already, china must be a bigger threat than I thought.
Thank you! This helped me on my excel homework !!!!!! -[A thankful college student]

Totally agree man. The Knicks (and the whole league, for that matter) need to play with more heart and less B.S. Get the Knicks Complete History on DVD, it's great to go back and watch the old playoff games...so many great memories!

This reminds me of the book "Longitude" by Dava Sobel about the invention of the marine chronometer...great book!
You are evidently uninformed. These people are trying to create legitimate green business opportunities. They have already succeded in starting a concentrated solar photovoltaic manufactureing division. Plus many other succesful spinoffs of thier endeavors over the last several years. There has been bumps in the road, but if it was easy everyone could do it. What have you done lately to reduce the worlds carbon footprint? Please be slow to criticise untill you have all the facts.
The music start at 4:19 Nice Song If You From South Central

You are so sexy! And I like how honest you are, " not like the one you have at the restaurant but it's pretty good enough." Wont cheat. Marry me and cook for my fat ass!

0:24 Birnes: "You guys want evidence? Melanie will show you the evidence." Sounds very convincing but as always, their claims and emotionally-charged language come to nothing. This is is *no way* evidence that aliens are visiting our planet. Is it unusual? Of course. But we've all seen unusual things and they're hardly proof of anything so outlandish as alien/human crossbreeding. Hate these guys.
Great just the way I teach
then you do it dipshit the album came out yesterday. stopp bitchinnyoo
I think the Ridgeline is fantastic, but the one thing it has always lacked is a more powerful V8. I mean, 250bhp...come on.

And, oddly enough, it had nothing to do with the fact that she has a nasally voice or even that one of two guys ate a shrew and then sifted through poo to look at what came back.Too bad I didn't have an ahkshuwaytor.

@savage44ever 
Thanks for posting this fun video. Loved it. The music is Stan Kenton's "Harlem Folk Dance." Ted Herbert, the hilariously prissy, bumbling "professor," is no doubt the look-alike brother of comedian Hugh Herbert, who made dozens of films in the 30's and 40's, and who played a similar simpering, giggling character.
I feel like such a moron trying to reload this, it keeps freezing. Lol, terri sent this to me. -with no warning. 0.o
love this song
One of the reasons this injury takes months to heal is because you use your pec minor constantly. When you raise your hand you are using your pec minor. Go to shake someones hand? Using the minor again. You basically can't avoid using it, but you have to stetch it out well (have a PT do it, don't trust yourself) and strengthen it (also with a PT),
Our govenment should stop policing the word, instead, the should take care ist citizens healthy the way americai is to be.
Appreciate your review. I'm looking into barefoot myself and your rundown of features and explanation of sizes helps. Thanks.
Nice song. Does anyone have a good bass cover fir this song???Post it please.
Aaah, I see. I was beginning to wonder if the scene was from the 5th movie. I thought it was supposed to be from the 6th. Incidentally, when the 5th movie came out is when I started losing interest in Harry Potter. XD;
This is a very good film, I found it for free here: viewfilmsfree (.) com

The proof is in your misleading video at 7:07.First, you attack other lock companies, then you attack the companies that test them, and now you're attacking the people who you're trying to mislead? Yeah, those business ethics are gonna get you far.
you have a great figure! luckky youu
my bathtub has the jets and i NEVER use it when im in the tub because its so powerful, one time me and my little cousin were playing around, and we poured the WHOLE bottle of bubble bath in, and tunred the jets on, and the Whole ENTIRE bathroom was filled with bubbles!! FUN TIMES!!
Maybe if English was your first language you won't have taken my verbal beating so badly. I'm glad you heeded my advice and pissed off, as we both know where this would have ended.May I ask, do you have a job? It's just I'm trying to imagine who has the time to argue at the hours you do, and I just get 2 answers, which is that you're either a student or unemployed, or maybe even work part-time, either way something tells me the anger you show is at yourself for not achieving much at life?
-cries-this is such a shame ):child abuse is horrible.i hope you are ok now,all your poems are great :)

Sometimes people do not feel sympathy.....Some just have a curious interest about killers- I do because I like to learn about the human being and the animal that is in us all...yet most of us believe could never be unleashed-yet can-
I like the imagery in the background during the interview - really projects the feeling of passion and freedom with your art
@jorgeplascencia08 i feel skeptical but Im also the kind where Im desperate Im about to try anything...I will say a prayer for you that things will get better!

@beatlefied70 Nah, he said it was because he was "exhausted" when he gets through with the show and doesn't want to be bothered. He says people are always coming up to him after the show and he just wants to be left alone. I can see where he's coming from

Why is my post repeatedly removed?Five times it is posted then removed.whats up with YT?
As a Christian, it is mind-boggling to me that Jews can't enter Joseph's Tomb. Though Israel regularly hurts herself by her concessions & appeasement, I am surprised that she has not protected this site for Christians (since we consider Joseph to be a "type" of Christ).
i didn't expect the cheapo speakerset, i was thinking of audiophile 2.0 speakersets from M-audio or whatever. oh right, u still need a screen + keyboard.And why such a high end PSU? when it only has 1 gfx card, and a few harddrives.i'd say an 850w modelwould be more thn enough for this, but it's always nice to have extra power when it's time to upgrade
man y is this so beeeppiinnng good

Great video. I already know how to make a brochure and everything, but I was hoping someone could tell me why my print preview cuts off at about 1/2" before the right edge of the paper. I've checked the margins and even set them on zero. I've also made sure the grid guides (imaginary blue dotted line) are at the very edge of the paper. No matter what I do, my problem doesn't go away. And I definitly know it's not my printer because like I said, this error also shows up on the preview.
It looks like something is peeking around the door om the right at :53 and if you pause it at :54 you can see it even better.. it looks like black curly hair.. then right when ur leaving the room look on the floor to the left at 1:34 in the exact same spot where the black curly thing was.. there is a see-thru anomaly
You are a pathetic Loser! If you going to spread crap take some lessons from the decease Nazi Propaganda Minister Joesph Goebbels!! Yep your fat pig Dear Leader Kim allowed 2 million of his own citizens to die from starvation. I hope you are proud of this.....
This was a pretty good documentary, but there were some things they didn't explain. How do the skewers land? How do they take off in the first place? How can the gyrosprinters mate with their back legs fused together like that? What exactly are those jet-darter things? What caused the oceans to evaporate? How do the grovebacks bury themselves? I was kind of looking forward to them eventually explaining these things.
GUST GO TO HELL THAT IS NOT A JOKE IS IT ??
wtfff! kimmm that was supposed to be personal!
Angel, thank you so much for taking time to stop by and listen, I really appreciate it, my friend :)Tom
the tension in this scene in the flat is unbelievable....they are such good actors to create such an amazing atmosphere because even though what they are doing is wrong, you find yourself seeing their point of view and supporting their relationship, where as in reality, you wouldn't...well I wouldn't. Incredible Streep and Niro!!!
ahhh the starship i was bravo 787th what class was this mine was january - june 09
What really stinks is this Wheat Thins commercial.
I have tried and saying "grapefruit" twice also works.
Ok so name me one scientist who does not agree or who has disagreed through "peer review" who you do not consider an idiot. Obviously peer review in this field is worthless. We need more than "it's likely." From what I have seen the whole group of AGW scientist should be thrown out.
Okay I never comment on this show but Alan Colmes, come on no need to invite this guy to your show, he is the Media equivalent of Tom Daschle, he sucks

@IGBJKLHOIGI The real god? Then why does that read "There's no other god than allah"? Shouldn't it read there's no other 'alah' than 'alah'? Hmm?? BTW, 'alah' in paleo hebrew (such as the inscription in the film) means CURSE. Go figure.
all this needs is yngwie malmsteen.

the squeeze machiene is kind of like meditating :) I want to go to Colorado State University to become a student of Dr. Grandin's. She is brilliant and I too am interested in the humane treatement of animals; but also people. I'm against Monsanto's GMO corn and hormones and antibiotics that are directly affecting people who work with the animals. I think all animals are entitled to sunlight (which most chickens do not get that privalege). I also think small farms are better than mass production

For anyone considering cataract surgery...don't watch this video! I'm sorry that I did. It caused unnecessary anxiety. I had this surgery two days ago. Before the surgery I was given drops to numb the eye. The sedative they give you in the operating room put me out immediately. I was not awake during the procedure. . I had very little pain afterward. A Tylenol took care of it. And the difference in eyesight is phenomenal.

@mobbvillan1 108.5 ft lbs of torque is listed in the service manual. And your torquing the nut, not the actual clutch assembly. I've heard people say 6th gear and I've also heard 1st gear. I personally used 1st gear but when I do it again I'll try 6th.

You did the work so long ago, but your tip was good about the save room. It's just that it saves your exact status when it saves. It saved before you picked up the health kits the first time. So you needed to pick up the kits exit then walk back in to save again to keep the health. Then load and you would have the life and more kits.

@Birdieupon He's obviously just going to Haiti for the attention (and thus, all the money it brings to pad his hefty bank account). If the filthy scourge of religion must exist on this planet, it would best be done behind closed doors, in private.
I agree with this man! Thank you for standing up for the truth!
I know this has nothing to do with the faith itself, but I had to comment: At 7:04, that is a BEAUTIFUL family. Not only are they physically beautiful, but they seem so happy and united! And that little girl and her mother are just gorgeous!
i wonder if it's coincidence that this came out the same time that Watership Down was written.

You know that whole "humans use only 10 percent of their brains" myth is exactly that, a myth. I still think a prepped Frank Castle could kill Slade.
the aunts and uncles are hilarious and so frisky! Mark and fun are so cute!
Wise words! Inspiring!
it was horrible to hear my love goes to him...but its kinda like chris brown and rihanna thing im like ok...do u kno that even though she got beat once maybe even twice, there r ppl out here getting beat 24/7 but theyr so afraid to escape or tell anyone bcus the creep might kill em if they try?
Tak for din skarpe iagttagelse og opsummering om "Big Tobacco". Om folk vil se filmene "The Insider" og "Control Factor" og sammenhold med det, der foreg?r i deres eget liv, da vil mange se meget store lighedstegn. Tak for din ord.
@CarringtonVilla I think the real question is, what exactly do you have to contribute?
I say install Ubuntu! :D
wow, big boobs much? LOL
Great job! Really enjoyed your video!
He is so fine.
I have to agree, it sounds like the same B.S just a different time. Will we ever learn?
that was very usefull adam
:*^( very sad that all those men had to die the way they did. One of the saddest chapters in human history.
You, Sir, are a sad bigot. God loves everyone on this earth, and homosexuality is not a sin. Gay marriage will one day be legal in every state.. :]
im sorry but this extremely boring. Im from port, and i was excited to see that someone made a documentary. but come on.

Its amazing how a simple post of a song will provoke a racial related comment. Why can't you just enjoy the music. Its obvious that you searched for it and the reason wasn't race. The reason was because it sparked a memory or you like the song. Chill out people! Just listen to the music. Good to go?
Then why did we let you be free again???? Why let you???? Why have a revolution over something planned?? I'm not a racist but that gap is left out.
I was wondering this, it's because in some of the songs he prefers to mess around with toys and stuff during certain songs, so he leaves it ot the other guitarist. But then last year when he had the car crash he got a permentant guitarist cause he couldnt play =[
ha! that dude looked like he crapped his pants when jesse walked in..lol..
The entire series of video clips, hosted btw by a free internet hobbyist service, amounts to nothing more than people opposed to the Lisbon Treaty, but not having the intelligence to state WHY they are so opposed.
Do they still use the covered wagons on the winter plow trains?
You guys are SO good. :)
The music may not be of good quality. The Police Band is playing the tune 'General Salute'. You can also hear the Buglers playing their version of 'General Salute' (which they play when the Guards change at the Quarter Guard).Tvm. Special Armed Police (SAP) was formed when the Travancore Nair Infantry regiments were phased out, or moved into existing Infantry regiment (Madras Regt.). Travancore Nair Infantry in earlier days of the king provided bandobust duties for the 'Aarattu' festival.
Everyone Democrat in Congress and in his administration made the same claim, including Hillary. Did you believe Clinton when he said Sadam possessed WMD?

I have been searching for this song for over 40 years. When I was in Libya in the 60's, my friend used to bring this little 45 lp to all dance parties. I finally found it today, what a relief!!

oh man, when you said molested I laughed so hard
thanks kripp, another good guide
HEAVY! I love the theremin.
amazing!
WillVill28Yes, but facts are irrelevant when dealing with attention whores, religious zealots and bigots.It does not seem to matter that the State Department validated his birth record, nor that the State of Hawaii has posted a sworn statement vouching for its authenticity.There are people for whom facts are incidental annoyances when compared to the dire importance of skin color and politics.
@MapleDork ugh you're a mind reader. i wonder what the champions of charity would've been like had those five crews won instead...
@threezy350 I would have to agree, mainly because I wouldn't want my team to have to face these guys right now. Sure our schedule is tougher but we don't win every team in that tougher schedule, in fact we can lose quite a few games and are still a top 1
goddamn were you under a rock for Dec/Jan?
fuckin hot fred
Gaaaah, you fiend. the one person....I dont rightly know. I suppose id have to. Id sit her down and tell her how to do a british accent properly, for starters. Then id lecture her on morals and decency whilst occasionally stopping to sip from my cup but maintaining a stern glare. then we'd get in to an argument and id call her something too ghastly to type, throw my (now empty) cup on the floor and inform her ive had better tea dates in my foulest nightmares.
@RettoT wtf

I always thought thomas more was an asshole. he basically ruined his family's life with his execution just so that he could have a perfectly clear conscience. back in his time, a family couldn't survive without the man of the family (as you see later in the film). He needed to get his priorities straight and succumb to Henry
fuckin sick!! one of my inspirations rite here
That is where comprehension comes in. The dumbing down of America. Lets say you sit a child down to explain something to them. Regardless of all the plethora of info you give them, if the child has low comprehension skills, the child will continuously ask why. why? why? why?
Badass...Can't wait to see the whole film. Awesome trailer guys :D- Tom Bucag
It's been a long time since I listened to "Sound Affects" and unfortunately forgot about this amazing song. Stumbled onto it last night (watching the Rockpalast show they did 30 years ago).

Due to pressure from the school on releasing this film, we had to cut short the clone part. There was going to be an extensive and more complicated fight scene between SpudTrooper and Buzz Lightyear.
haha its funny verry funny XD
I am tired of the US medias which always define Putin as a dictator.

Iraq was booted out of Kuwait by the US. It fought an 8 year war with Iran. All of it's weapons were purchased from the west. The US knew exactly what Saddam had. I don't understand how anyone could believe our intelligence would be this inept. This is why so many quit after the invasion. Bush lied when he said the info was provided by our Intelligence. This is why so many angry books by former intelligence agents.
this performance is on limewire if you lot wanna download it
What was that last bit of audio they cut out?
he's all hyped up...no one knows what he had in that hand...1,100 phil's a funny dude

Cause alot of people think any form of touch even innocent touch like tickling is between guys is a sign of being gay and wanting more and def the furthest from the truth! Those people are not comfortable with themselves thats all!

this is very good.
thats sickkkk!
October 29th. Venus Inferior Conjunction. Weird things happen on or within a couple days of these events. 
I even hear LRAD go off once in my neighborhood. I'm cranking the speakers up and shooting the shit out of anything dish and speaker shaped. Lot's of people have gasoline and Humvee's make nice ovens. If you can get ahold of a bunch of mercury. Put it in big containers that can break on impact and it'll eat right through aluminum armor.What I'm watching is comex options expirations monday. If they can't keep gold below 1300 then it's max pain for the bullion banks and america is broke.
How could you say that USC team was not any good? We had Sam Clancy (2002 Pac-10 MVP), Brandon Granville, David Bluthenthal, an up and coming Desmon Farmer. I was shocked and still am shocked at that upset. USC that year was picked to go to the Final Four by Sports Illustrated. GO TROJANS!!! U-C-L-A SUCKS!! 
awesome!!!!!!!!
@orangebluemango dude.... Its a song about color because the lead singer of counting crows is of ethnicity
It was a good game. Most Canucks fans are cool with me and the ones that made it to the Honda Center were pretty classy. I sat close to this group of Canucks fans and one them had a poster that read, "you wish you had swedish twins" lol
why dun they have this in cantonese version?
wtf game of love O.o
Great fuckin video bro killed it man nicee.
You got good grades in music? I hope you're kidding and not really trying to say that taking a guitar and piano class means you've studied music. I have a bachelor's in music and even after years of analyzing compositions by many of the greats, I don't feel I've even scratched the surface. That's the difference between you and I; you've settled and are easy, like the rest of the simples that buy into what they're force fed. I'm discerning and actually pay attention. Creed is terrible.
Thank you so much! For the first time I managed to do a stitch after watching the video less than a hundred times :)
Can you use the steering wheel controls to change songs and such on the Zune?
Doesn't matter...Richard Nixon/Spiro Agnew would have still won the White House and did a better job in my view of history back then.
was it necessary to use the word "shitty?"and hunny , if you dont to hear their voices , might as well search up another video and stop trying to be a badass with all these comebacks :)
holy shit that guy swung that club hard
I love San Fransisco, spots everywere
it doesnt matter if dada goes to 0..only matter is HIS tram won today by his rules...

Downie ALWAYS gets his ass kicked. He's lucky he never had to square up with guys like Stu Grimson, McSorley, Tony Twist, or Bob Probert. He'd be dead right now.

Here we go. Censorship. So long first amendment!
thank you. like the first thirty seconds helped me with my problem lol. do u think u can make one on how to make npcs' move one or two steps at a time? that would really help me.
And didn't Capp rather crudely put the moves on her?
Ehhhh... I think you're misusing corpus delicti. The corpus delicti is a test to determine if the crime being charged has actually occurred. For example, if we want to charge someone with murder, we have to show there has been a murder first. To do this we use the corpus delicti. You're trying to use it as a means of defining which actions are crimes. That's really outside the scope of what the corpus delicti is meant to do. I don't think any court has actually applied it this way.
I've played every RE game. These movies do the game GREAT justice. They have their own story line sort of. So maybe that's what people get upset about. But when it comes to some detail like different types of zombies, dogs, gadgets, weapons they're spot on. The 3D on this movie was amazing and best I've seen. I feel like it was a lil boring and I hated how it ended. Seems like they're trying to make it more of a story driven Action film rather then a story driven horror film which it should be.
@daymyth tell me you are joking. Oh no, u are serious.OMG, you actually believe what you are saying. well. Good luck to you.
WRYYYYYY!!!
I know how you feel, sadly my fathers funeral was on 14th Jan.

Yep, pretty much, lol! It adds to the overall appeal of the game IMO! :D
Yeah this one has a lot better video quality than the other one.
@gaiusscholasticus; I don't assume any rights, my friend, because I wasn't there.
no madaras brother is definately dead, madara took both of his brothers eyes and danzo only has the sharingan because when itachi killed shisui it was under danzos orders because danzo wanted a sharingan himself.
I have listened to many subliminal tapes, but this is certainly beyond anything I have ever experienced in this kind of genre. and, the art is incredible!

Wow, lots of cool things about UNT that I didn't know, and I went there! :)
im glad to see some 1 got they eyes open
There is no better Punk Rock band than the Ramones! And thats my opinion.
it's not really fair. everyone except Terra, Ven, and Aqua, the three HEROES of the story, got a happy ending.
if you collect all of them in every story you get 1 achievement. so basically no.
Daug La Salle :)
Review vegetarianism, please.

Very cool view of the inside of MMA, love Shields and his crew, looks like the real deal.
looks fun, i might go there next year. what dorms are those? and how nice are they compared to like brandt( if that isn't brandt)?
I saw the theatrical version in the theater and the opening credits were very erotic. I know...for those who don't recall it had Buck and various women mackin on the Buck Rogers logo. If I recall correctly.
I saw Pepsi without High Fructose Corn Syrup, I was really surprised.
fuck u i ment the video dumbass
With that being said all galactus would have to do is convert the yellow suns energy into any matter he wants to strip superman of his powers or restructure the molecules in supermans body into kryptonite or simply teleport him to a different galaxy where there is no yellow sun.
wait, so, remind me again what he would know about anything? he fucked up countless albums(surfer rosa, in utero), and has his head way up his own ass.
This is such a powerful video. It is amazing to see what you guys are doing for these beautiful women and children. Dave
thats shocking!
She is ok. but song sucks.

i kinda wish clay aiken ((unicef ambassador)) was in that commercial more than once...:((
I love it
Stacey's so much better than the new blonde girl.
dope as usual! rare finds...
Loved this video :)
Big Meaty and Bouncy! And that organ ROCKS. Maybe a little Wolfmother would be a good choice for the band.This is my idea of what a rock band sounds like.
ethier of those would be acceptable too
This guy remeinds me of a chubby Doug Henning!

Who is to say that they have not invaded....subversely creating a race of ingnoant, consuming slaves! Remember perception is reality....our collective eyes are being opened to things that are not from this world....and so we must ask the question... Are "we" from this world? We have step by step been leaving the earth the day we put shoes on. Think about it....deeply.
I used to play mandolin and sing in a band with some girls who played bluegrass. I was a bit wild for them. They were sheltered. I chose the band name "Pickin' on Molly". They loved it. They thought the banjo's name was Molly. I thought it was funny. It was really just a variation on Flogging Molly.
it goes hard!!!!!!!!!!!
omg that is awesome.
Please look & listen to this spiritually stimulating Youtube video*September 19Th*Mark Lakeman of City Repair is coming to LA & will be teaching a very groovy hands on workshop @ HM157*

Yes, but in reality (especially at that time) he certainly would have incurred the displeasure of the tennis club members by turning up on court wearing casual trousers, shoes and long sleeve shirt!
sounds abit like richard dreyfuss
How very beautiful, CC. I would certainly love to walk there among such lovely landscapes.
I aggree, that kinda police brutality is detremental to the confidence the public has. Thoes arse wipes should be fired and arrested however much like politicians, they will 'get away with it'.
@MultiUncensored You're the one who's pissed because a crtic gave thumbs down to some movie you like. Faggot.

Hey Pal,
exelent explanation
You misinterpreted my post. I was not taking potshots at athe NO. Yes, I do like the Extraordinary Form but a NO Mass can be for me ,just as beautiful when the Ars Celebrandi is the forte' of a Priest. Just because I would have like to see both forms of Mass featured in the series does not warrant your assumption of my zeal. If a Priest celebrates either form badly it speaks for itself and I need not take potshots at 1 form or the other. Your zeal towards my comment is the only thing misguided.
Thanks for mirroring.Maybe you'll have more success. 450 views in the last 5 days for my channel.It should have EXPLODED considering it was the only video of Othman denying she is "Ambassador to Space Aliens".Here's the thing about this though, she REALLY IS "Director" of "United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs" so the News reports were essentially correct. They just reported her TITLE incorrectly, which forces Othman to DENY it.So, did the media do this to discredit the truth?

my youth showed this sermon video to us today at church and i just LOVED this song! most christian songs aren't harsh enough (in a positive way) and really send out the message, but this one did and i think God REALLY spoke to Kendall bout this one!!! thanx for this AWESOME powerful song!
where you at alaska??? this has to be old footage.
@gwargwar1981 I just realized they did something to the webcam software on youtube, when I heard my dog lapping up water, I dont think I'll have to hold the mic up anymore, after I painted it black and everything. Mike said it looked like a tampon.hahahah
This is the best cover of anything I've ever heard
What matters is the sound of the song and not how he looks.Thank god stephen hawking in wheelchair all his last two decades would not have had the chance to do his doctorate in physics but also regarded as the living einstein,he would have no chance in some people's world.

This kid is cute..can't get credit for a phone, a car or a house. Maybe he can scrape up some money somewhere to buy some shampoo and wash his hair. As they go on, his hair is getting greasier and nasty...
Awesome Video.
You really are an idiot aren't you? It is hyper saline, and part of the ecosystem of the area. Go look at a global map... you can clearly see that Salton Sea was once the top end of the Sea of Cortez... and through years of sedimentary deposits, became a land-locked inland sea.The summers make the edges more saline, and have less oxygen available... the stronger healthier fish travel to the deeper sections of the lake and are fine. You really are an idiot....
Is it necessary to own a large white tunic to be a cult leader? If so I have been going about this all wrong with my jogging suit!
Never give In!
I choose to celebrate his life, not question his death!
Very nice video. And such a beautiful song. Thank God we have people like Nichole Nordeman to help put words to the praise that our hearts feel toward our Lord. What a blessing her music has been to me and my walk with the Lord.
yeah it is b/c how else could they make lip gloss ! I still luv yah Jory!

what the fuck is the name of the song
oh my godd thats so sadgreat chapter!
Europeans thought they could import muzzies to use as cheap labor, and that decision was the beginning of your collective cultural suicide. You did not understand the nature? of those you brought into your midst. And whenever one of your own stands up for your culture and heritage, you denounce them and call them racist. Your only hope for survival as a people is mass deportation.
brilliant free runing
thanks for posting
Nice
I swallow it every tuesdayNow that is funny.
Does anyone know what year the scenes on the Rapid City, SD line were shot?
does it cost money?
I only see two modes in Darkmount...kinda sick of the lame third modes...i would rather have them focus just on two modes and keep them solid...but i do have to wonder what is so hard in designing a tank that can also turn into convincing looking turret

@23eirish well let's see what the new album 'Black Magic' is like...by the way Tupac had songs like Keep ya Head Up ,I Get Around ect..Biggie & Jay each made too many songs for the ladies to even count so you probably really hate all those guys' music .

Variation is key to muscle growth - you need to make your body "guess" on what the next exercise in the workout will be.When comparing incline dumbbell to barbell press - the barbell press is more isolated and even though it makes your stabilising muscles work - the amount that those smaller muscle groups get is much lower. Also incline dumbbell press can involve a tiny amount of shoulder work.Personally I like the dumbbell press :)
please check out my first animation .... :D
I love this video. So important to remember the bodies needs and compliment our vibrations of being.
Wow you guys make me smile... Speedy can you speed talk while making love?

God made them to understand He is always in control and He tells how He want His people to worship Him. He changed their usual meeting router and made himself strong... God is great.

To be fair, I don't think Mat grew up playing basketball, so he was fighting an uphill battle from the start. Hopefully he took advantage of the free schooling and got his degree from a premier school in the U.S. He had his fair share of distractions...multitudes of hot women threw themselves into his bed reportedly...so who could blame him for falling victim to 'Neil Reed Syndrome'? (What 19 yr. old could resist that?) Play a Sade song & tell them they are the most beautiful woman ever! ;^))

Success! Thank you! I'm with dmnyli, below. It took some time to "see" the inverter plug. I used a tiny nail on the end of a hemostat (clamp) to work the cable clip in. The tips of my fingers are still sore from holding back the clutch cover! Another issue -- keeping the sleep magnet in place as you reattach the frame. I finally held it down with the eraser end of a pencil. .Just one mystery -- I double-checked all around the frame. I couldn't figure out where that "extra" screw goes!
I saw when you originally did this on Brunch with Bridget and I laugh hysterically every time I hear it.

Hey guys, Blizzard is being rediculously stupid with their "anti-hack" and "atni-gold buying" crap and closed my account for "buying gold"... which of course I'm not stupid enough to do.. but either way.. I won't be making any more videos, unless they give the account back. Hope you guys really enjoy this video. Peace! ~Ufayah
Lots of great highlight moments. I just think the music was a little subdued compared to the highlights. It just didn't seem to mesh too well with the awesome beatings I was watching. Overall a decent HL compilation though.
She stayed a long time. Good girl Una!
I absolutely love your vids!!!! I was a 100% expensive brush buyer until I saw this video. I don't even want to think about all the money I have spent on Trish McEvoy, Stila and MAC brushes. Don't get me wrong they are great and I love them but $ does not always equal quality, I think it's great you are showing people that might not be able to afford the expensive things that there are other options and not pushing the expensive ones because you know what they say...it's all about the tool.

@PARANOIDnickANDmatt A lot of the Japanese artists I'm into [mainly rock] sound exactly as they do when they're on stage and on their CDs - it's amazing to hear them. It's one of the reasons why I love this band.
That's because it was eventually deleted from the game (along with the scene with Max driving a car alongside the train.)The two scenes appear in the game's intro anyway, regardless of them never happening.
lmaoo, 
haha sounds like something i would probably do
I have a 79 with big wheels in the back and its a pain in the ass because they keep rubbing and my tires keep getting slashed and ripped. I love those wheels but I need to find a way to make it work.

You cannot see proof of God until you are willing to listen to people who know God. They have His "license," what He looks like, what He does, etc. But you are a stranger. Would you show a stranger your friend's personal information? No. First, you must be willing to listen. That's great that you want to contribute to humanity; but even an animal dies having contributed to others. I think humans, w/ higher intelligence, can strive for more in life, and reach beyond material boundaries.

I love it when he says "no more drum, no more guitar," but yah went the old time way, hand clapping, tambarine, and foot stomping. It remians me of when we went to methdosit comvention and the young people took over, then the elders join in a helped. Praise Him

I will believe that the economy is turned around when our debt is paid off, and when Obama is not borrowing 41 cents of every dollar he spends from China. I will believe that this is not a false recovery when we start producing our own goods. Look at the trade deficit guys... Our money is going overseas, then coming back in the form of debt. The only reason the dollar is where it is now is because the countries holding our debt are waiting to bail out, with minimal losses. We are in for it...

Just to clarify a point. Stannard asks whether he is meaningless if he is not being observed. This a a non-sequitur of what has gone before. It was stated that QUESTIONS relating to objectivity are meaningless, not reality itself. Stannard is a subject/object. not a question therefor he is not meaningless
I thought making the 'street toughs' seem gay was an absolute stroke of genious. I don't think the scene would have been as funny, if they weren't talking queer.

I seem to be repeating myself - doh!!
I love this song especially this treatment. Slow and accoustic without grand gospel back up. Michael, your voice is so soft and sexy in this one. Had a good night's sleep, eh? Peace big man and say hi to Carl cuz I love HIM!!!!!!!!!

To: vivrin07 Dude, you've been brainwashed. Look at the early BBC and The Guardian reports from the region. They clearly say and show that the Georgians started this mess by breaking the ceasefire and shelling the Ossetian civilian centers.

Hallelujah!!!! Glory, Glory Glory
When is the next one coming??

Use common sense. Does it smell ok? If it does then taste it. Does it taste ok? Then it is ok. 
People...simply make sure you have your arms and ammo, WELL STOCKED and hide them...somewhere away from your home, but in a place they are safe and no one is likely to find them...That way, when IT GOES DOWN you will NOT be disarmed...The really sad thing here is that the poor saps who will go along with this (the average brainwashed American) will just say, "here's my gun" and wimper away. You should stash your arms, and then BS the bastards. Run your OWN psi-op on them!God Bless America!
How come no one has addressed the cop killer gun the guy used? It shoots 20 rounds semi-automatically. You can just go to a store and buy it. Anyone can. It's our right.
If you actually use these kinds of bulbs you better turn em off for good and get rid of em!
I have no idea, but if you find out please let me know.

@MaoriNinjah Dude If your talking about the tattoo it going to cost you a good 1,000 to 2 500 Depends on the artist how much they charge per hr which they are going to because its going to take more then one session and of course the detail of the piece.
@beauttty07 cuz Bob's half black half white, and Damian's mom is white...so basically his hair is white, so it can grow reeeeal long

@mrlagxSure, I hear you and agree fully. But it just goes back to the joy thing for me.I look at it this way: I am going to serve my God as best as I can, in the best way I know how, studying the scriptures and devoting my life to prayer. If I go down in
Yup, the power to weight ratio for the Corvette is great. Although it is not built for the straight line it does make a good drag. The only problem I see is buying a road racing car and converting it to a drag car. Not cost efficient. Your right, it is a matter of what you can afford.
this was impressive. I have tried to play this and it has never coem out very well. Kudos to this guy, major kudos to him :-)

For C you could have used that video of kevin droping the cake! That video is SO funny!
make sure to pull up PBS.. NOVA episodes with the title.WHAT DARWIN NEVER KNEW".. this ones called." What Darwin didn't know".... which is no where near the same & no where as good in information.... AND MAKES YOU THINK WHY DID THEY DO THAT MAKING A SPINOFF PBS... VERSION... AND USING A SIMILAR TITLE... SO THEY COULD CONFUFUSE PEOPLE... ASSHOLES*

i like how these adds pop up 1 second before the show fades to black for commercial break -_-
Funny
i have alot of live dvds not necessarily released professionally
i don't think jo and blair were too cozy. it was natural to pair them up for a couple reasons. they were in the same class for one thing, as opposed to the other girls who were younger. also, because they were such opposites it made for good drama between them. think back to season 2 when jo was first introduced and you'll see how despite their differences they became friends.

I went into FYE to buy something, and this album was on in the store. I knew i needed it as soon as i heard it.
awesome thanks!!
I would guess a good chunk of the people watching it probably weren't even born when that song was around, not like us old fogies. lol
I am SO glad somebody sent me this song. It reminds me of old school good music. If anybody knows anymore bands like this PLEASE inform me.
Wow, and I thought the 3rd job skills were good... these are insane! o.0
I'm not wasting any more of my time researching well outside my expertise for you. I've given you what you asked, and you ignored it. You have not given me anything I asked for. If you want to attempt to argue the case for abiogenic oil, find a geologist who supports biogenic oil and go wild.
Whatever they play this band hits the spot!It pulsates with an irresistible rhythm.I find listening to them balm to my ears and mind.This piece is wonderfully performed.Thank YOU mr Bloggs.
She's due for a major lifestyle up-grade at this point, if not just for safety reasons, she's known world wide, she's already proved what she needed to, now it'll be about staying power.

No bad at all!!!!!!!!!
i feel sorry for flippy =(
@skinnyhurley man you're so on with that one. It happens all the time. most of us want no harm to anyone etc but, we seem to come off as combative or just aloof.
yes, lets sit around idle praying to someone that doesnt exist. instead of standing up and doing something, we should just pray, of course our god that doesnt exist will help us!

Fr. Crosby has done a beautiful job! The cribs are a labor of love for him! I contributed a crib from Costa Rica to his collection last year. I hope I can see it in person someday!
Great video ,nice place to stay,well edited and good voice over.
You didnt address why Oregon went into Michigan in 2007 and punked the wolves 39-7 nor why did what is turning out to be a very weak SC team go into Columbus and punched the big10 champs.
This was truly beautiful; only one problem -- it was too short! 
holy crap!!! i love starcraft being a korean....omg i am just speechless!!!!! xD

@BionicDance LOL. Sure you can claim certain religious claims are false. That's not what I said though. If you claim that god or gods do not exist, and that I am full of shit for believing it, you're purely speculating.Proof of God:Not going to happen.Rea
idk how long gomez signed the contract with montreal but they will get rid of him when they can, after that he'll go to a shitty team like atlanta and he might stay there for some time and that will be the end of him
I am not sure what Bill Kristol has on Fox. Otherwise, just based off of the wacky and totally inaccurate analysis and predictions he gave for how well the War in Iraq was going in 2003-05, he lost any sense of credibility with me. Now whenever I see him offer an opinion on anything I know the opposite must be true.

The tunes came off an album called "Rambler '64 Going Great!...With That Rambler Spirit!" The LP was used "By Rambler Dealers and Salesmen in Showrooms During Public Announcement of the '64 Ramblers" (it says all this on the album cover). There are 9 songs on the album that glorify the various 1964 models. I've seen the album turn up on Ebay. I bet if you set up an Ebay search, it will show up again sooner or later.
gunna go read the next one now...poor sel! she's not miley and she wil never be miley...her mom needs to respect that

They are all unconious because there is no air being pumped into the plane,Engineers did a seal test earlier on in the day and turned the Air switch that puts air into the plane from automatic to manual.But when the engineers finished they forgot to put the swiitch back on to automatic and neither the pilot or co pilot relised the switch was on manual so as they got pass a certian altitude the air thins and they sleep into unconsinous.....

great video!!! good explanation
Just saw their show over the weekend, and it brought one thing to mind. These guys still rock out and preform better than nearly any other metal band out there. The fact their hair has changed and they have aged hasn't slowed them down, they can put on an amazing show. I feel like they could go on another 20 years after seeing them
Anti-Snake.. hahahahah
Cant wait to hear Jeezys new mixtape :D
Great job with this song and video Dustin!!
@saywatThafuckiwant this isnt nu metal its metalcore asshole.

He should be with Selena Gomez .They were cute together.
@jpizzy9689 i agree, most these people that fight on here i doubt they even grew up in the country, cause if they did those boys and girls would learn some damn respect and stop treating each other like crap

could yes, but probably not. fedor took care of herring better than lesnar and carwin had real trouble keeping it standing w/ ganzaga til he knocked him out (granted, gonzagas a beast). Mirs going to need mental recovery from the lesnar beating and will prob be out for a while. I wouldn't put odds on any of them against fedor. but yeah, they might beat him, just not likely. fedors faster than any of them, strong, and has fight smarts. granted, shane and lesnar are prob stronger.
Togara you must get into the voice-over industry ... you have incredible vocal dynamics!

MMD doesnt like Ritsu. I love his outfit shorter, it makes him look so sexy. But it has the "If Japanese Font is included in the file, please rewrite in english". I already have and Ive downloaded him like three times...Im rly sad
First off he has juggernaut and second off rpg are under powerd and third you are stupid -_-
It's about a high school boy who only likes older women who finds out he's been married to a twelve-year-old. Nobody asked him if he wanted to be, he just is. The couple are the two you see in this video. Then there's this guy at school and...
this song rips.....awesome tune!

Dearest Sam, you 'speak the undesirable truth' in such a way that you make us see that it is all we can desire. I think that you will 'dare to go where He leads' because you know (and make us all see)that elsewhere is into nothingness. God bless you beloved friend.

Rod serling of the Twilight Zone realized smartly that the Lusitania was a much,. much more imporatnt ship than the Titanic. He wrotea n hour long TZ ep where a man travels back in time to try to stop the Lusitania from getting torpedoed. Serling knew the Lusitania brought the US into WW1 where as the Titanic brought no country into anything!
Years ago I used to spend a week in Fort William every year for the spring, weather was always good to me and the company was fantastic. Sadly I had to take a break from these trips for personal reasons in the mid 90's but by 2000 ish I managed to get there again. Never in my entire life have ever regretted making such a trip, never been there since and I'll never cross that border again.
It's set in Nazi Infested Paris, you liberate it from the nazi's by doing various tasks, but their's loads to side quests to do as well. It's like...GTA with a ..oldies look, I'd recommend it.

I know what you mean. Ever since I first saw this video on mtv I've been hooked on Michelle's music. Memories of East Texas really gets me. Why? Once drove from Indiana to visit friends in Austin and stopped in Gilmer for lunch on the square. Drove to Gladewater too, but it took me more than 15 minutes.

The song lacks the punch of Neil's quiet, ironic pronunciation. He should have sung it himself. Without him, it lacks conviction.

By looking at this review video, I would get the Kingston over the Intel x25M because the Intel is only supreme at opening apps but if u look at the video. The difference between the Kingston V+ and the Intel is like 1s or less. But the write speed is just way faster than the Intel. Do you guys agree?
Marlon's voice sure did change a lot. Michael's voice is just uber cuteness.
I love all the songs on this record but the production leaves alot of them sounding so flat and dead. Census and Headless Sky are fucking killer live, but so unimpressive on the album itself.
nice would you do a tutorial too? where you learn that BTW

Just some constructive criticism, if your going to make a vido saying how to do a certain thing, don't say why it should be done, actually do it in the video.

So much chemistry between Nat & Liv even when they dont like each other. This shows how incredible a person Nat is to care for someone she doesnt like. I need to follow in her footsteps.

Or...you can hire copyright lawyers and try to secure rights to music, or pay to have someone score the indy film project (assuming like myself you have no personal musical talents, I could be wrong...)or try to kiss ass and get some wanker off craigslist to score it for you with his casio keyboard in his mom's basement. Cinescore does the same thing that putting an effective and inexpensive camera in the hands of a novice does...allows ANYONE to realize the dream of making an indy film.
You do realize courts don't recognize sovereign citizenship, right? So when that creditor sues a sovereign, the court looks at that sovereign as a citizen of the United States, and accountable to its courts. So enjoy ignorance while it lasts.

The goal is not to have flashier web pages, but to start developing applications in Javascript. For that reason, we can use all the speed we can get.
YouTube fans want more Video footage of Jr Girl Slay!!!! Nuff Props!!
not only "green fuels"we need more thermal de polymerization plants to turn trash into bio diesel fuel.trash is plentiful.more solar research for home use,battery cars for around town use and the only reason to actually have a need for fuel is for long distance trips.
is this film inspired in part by Satyajit Ray's Mahanagar?
hahaha it was really funny and good!!!!!! :D
It would take a while... you have more at your disposal than just the dots, and you could gear more for damage than I was... but yeah... it might take a while.
it feels like the rythmn of the headache (the mantra)
Justin Gaberial was the first to beat a Pro

Rottweilers and Pit Bulls excel at tearing limbs. This is when they are in their glory. This dog (being stupid, like any dog) on an instinctive level feels he is tearing limbs; hence, he is happy.
not the best "how to" video but I think it was funny and cute so u get five stars from me. :)
I have some good information on how to get abs on my blog check it out

This song is for someone special in my life. I love you JP. Thank you for loving me, for making me feel like i am the most beautiful woman in the world. Remember, it all started at moonlight beach:-)
It's funny how many people fall over on these things. They accelerate so fast compared to everything else!
Hey, I can get to the the part in Folder Options where you click Show hidden files and folders, folders, and drives. But, once I click apply and go to my iPod, all the files I can find are picture files. What do you think I'm doing wrong?
Count me as someone who can't bear to listen to the released version, because it just sounds wrong, having heard Jon Brion's orchestration giving the song a grand scale that's reminiscent of Van Dyke Parks' work on the first Rufus Wainwright album. I wish she'd do it live with a string section, just as a one-off.
not so good
Nice!
these guys are really great , a very clever song
Congratulations guys on your 1 year anniversary!Anyone one that enjoys Indian cuisine has to experience the culinary delights that await them at Zeera By The Bay.What the mayor said is absolutely true, they make you feel like family, oh and try the fish!

If you were raised without the ability to question and challenge intelligently what you see on TV, then this video will feel like home. The most dangerous and highly addictive drug on this planet is right there in our sitting rooms. We tune in, open a can of stella and phase out.. The Orwellian nightmare is real and the media play a major role. like this video it uses sentimental music, platitudes and solgans to whip up emotions.. and it works. Truth is out there if you take the time to look.
deepa's not bad, but i wish shreya had come :(his expressions are really cute in this...haha
I love you
The majority of people are going to need and go out and practice how to orienteer from one point to another and practice getting to places tehy cannot see using a compass.

I know he didn't say that GP2 cars are slower, I'm saying that in my opinion I think the GP2 cars are more like F1 cars then the F3 cars as I've seen them both styled and perform like F1.
boa pergunta, vcs ten que fazer alguns videos sobre nos que somos casados com europeos e queremos morai ai
this is a good video but you need to stop pausing as it can get a bit boring.
@pobody69 its all about religion. satan is king and ruler of this earth. and while satan is here on earth, he wants to gather his army. and he will do this by influencing people to stray away from god as far as possible. THIS is where the illuminati come
Is this based off one of her books? This is probably one of the most fascinating things I have heard in awhile and one of the most fascinating things that she has talked about on here. I'd like to read about it more in depth.
PushaT raps like GFK and Malice like Rae
This song combines several goodness together. Better than some other peoples videos.
Hey - Best HA tribute ever!
where is your web site located Mike?
Hey Nutnfancy, just had a quick question. The difference between the R2 and the R5 I know is the looms. What makes the difference? Is it just the bulb housing? If so, every flashlight comes out with new ones so for people that own the R2 vs the R5 is it stupid to go out and buy an R5 if the only thing that makes a difference is the head?
r u from israel?
What about a situation where in 5 minutse a superintelligent AI helps your consciousness - using the existing atoms in the brain - to convert the matter to a more synthetic substrate, all the while you remain conscious of the situation occurring, and the same pattern exists, just shifted in terms of substrate pattern only. It seems to me Massimo doesn't want to accept identity can be a digital entity (therefore copyable) as much as any computer program is a digital entity.
respect the vest, don't make take out my hose fucking genius Mazuka!

You must be a male-hating feminist, or a self-hating man.
@floodedjunior there's THREE seasons? i thought there as 2?
BEST PART: Minnie Decks the Cop XD
what if Kratos and Chuck Norris had a baby? D: bye bye existence :(
Mauldin is an idiot. If he knew his head from his a** he would have written a b ook BEFORE the collapse and predicted it instead of writing some stupid boo that wont tell you jack. Maudlin is a snake oil sellsman like many others in the media.
Good!
But after all: A Krupnik is a Krupnik! Is it a Krupnik.... (1:58)I have no clue what Morticia means, but it's hilarious how she says it =)

The economy was doing quite well when G.W. Bush took over and the economy tanked just as he was leaving office, but it happened because of "liberals over regulation of the markets"???
Yeah, true. But I can't find any recent videos of Kaku.

@Dayfoxx7000 
Is the Household model in use anywhere in New Hampshire?
hot damn

I agree. This is my fav episode of Nuke's. 
I think we all need to join together and crank up the volume at the same time while that song is being played to spread the word to the world to be quiet.Great clip... very clever!

I wonder if PD and Peri were shot dead, in the Whoniverse, would The Doctor still have regenerated into CB? Or are Time Lord fors coincdnetal on what they look like? I heard some Time Lords can choose their form. The Rani & Romana could. And it cant just be a female trait, because the 2 2nd doc was given the oppurtunity to choose his new form. Speaking of Romanas regen, why did Romana regenerate?
I grew up in Boulmer and know Main and John really well. Remember watching this on TV and it still brings back great memories of being a kid and going down to greet the fishermen as they came home.
thanks for the support!
i hate the X factor, the people who go on it have no talent or orininality, they don't right their own songs, and the only reason that one of them wins is because they have some sob story to try and win the voters over. i bet that he will be working in B&Q by about 2013. simon cowell is not a music fan as all of the people he has helped to create have no talent and last for about a week and a half. simon cowell is killing music and creativity and turning us into zombies by force feeding us shit.
love your description!
@RaiceaAndrei11 They are doing what we would call Kendo, based on kenjutsu. It is called "way of the sword" and its used to practice swordsmanship and form. They however are most likely using "kenjutsu" as this films era predates kendos creation
Best pizzas haha
are those people seriously going to threat mutants like that?!? i mean, they should know that the mutants can kick their ass and kill them in 30 seconds, but their too nice to do that!!!
I watched this while playing Aasim god wit the flow at the same timethat shit went hard
Lol, FIRE IS HOT.
Great video I love this song I heard it on OTH in an LP scene <3
